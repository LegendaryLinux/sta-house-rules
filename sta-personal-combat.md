### Melee Attack
Opposed **Daring + Security**. If target is unaware, D1.

### Ranged Attack
D2 **Control + Security**. If target is in cover, the roll is opposed, and the defender gets one free bonus momentum 
which may only be used to buy an additional dice.

### Counterattack
If the attack was opposed and the defender won, they may:
- Move out of reach **or**
- Spend **2 Momentum** to counterattack
  - Counterattacks may not occur beyond the first

### Opposed Attacks
Defender rolls first to set the difficulty. Attacker must meet or exceed the difficulty to hit.

### Avoiding Injury
A character may choose to gain stress equal to the severity of the wound to avoid taking an injury. If the stress
required to avoid an injury would cause a character's stress to exceed its maximum, the injury may not be avoided.

### Injury
If a character is hit by an opponent during an attack, they become **Injured**, and receive a trait representing
the injury. The severity of the injury should be included in the trait. *Ex. S2 Stab Wound*.  
**When a character suffers an injury, they are defeated.**
