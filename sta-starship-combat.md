# Star Trek Adventures Starship Combat Cheat Sheet

## Starship Combat

## Tractor Beams
Most starships have a tractor beam of strength Scale - 1.  
Attaching a tractor beam is a D2 **Control + Security** assisted by ship **Structure + Security**.  
A tractor of any size can be affixed to any ship or station.  
To escape a tractor beam, the task difficulty is equal to the tractor beam's strength.

## Starship Attacks
**Control + Security**, assisted by ship **Weapons + Security**.
- D2 for energy weapons
- D3 for torpedoes

### Starship Damage
When a ship is hit by weapons fire, the shields are damaged, and the results depend on the table below.

| Shield Value | Effect                                                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Above 50%    | Nothing                                                                          |
| Below 50%    | Ship becomes shaken. CO rolls for minor damage from *Shaken Minor Damage Table*. |
| Below 25%    | Ship becomes shaken. If ship was already shaken, ship suffers a breach.          |
| 0% (Offline) | Ship suffers a breach.                                                           |

### Breaches
Breaches can increase the difficulty of tasks performed with the associated system, and depending on the severity of
the breach, can make some tasks impossible.

If a single system suffers breaches >= half the ship's scale, the system is destroyed. Any task performed with a
destroyed system automatically fails.

If a ship suffers more breaches than its scale, the ship has taken critical damage, and can no longer function.  
Any additional breaches will destroy the ship.

### Repairing Damage
The *Damage Control* action can be used to repair a breach, in addition to a character repairing it personally.
The difficulty to repair a breach is Severity + 1. Repairing a breach in person is a **Daring + Engineering** task.

Repairing a breach does not remove it, but instead removes the negative effects associated with it. If the same system
suffers an additional breach, any repaired breaches are reopened and the severity increases according to the incoming
damage.

Breaches cannot be fully repaired in combat.
